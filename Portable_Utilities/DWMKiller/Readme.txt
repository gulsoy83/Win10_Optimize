- You might need to add more processes to the win10_dwm_tool.ini file if you get a black screen after disabling DWM.
- Close UWP apps before disabling DWM! Otherwise you will experience graphics glitches.
- If somehow get a black screen while playing without DWM just try pressing ALT+TAB and ALT+F4 these keys still work!
